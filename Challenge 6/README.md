# Challenge 6: Suns, blackholes and leap years.
## Problem Statement 

    Write a pure function that takes the duration an imaginary planet takes to revolve 
	around it's star or blackhole (in days and hours, for example 365 and 5 hours) as 
	an input and determines how many days a year should the planet have and subsequently 
	it's leap year rule.
    
Your program should work something like this:
```
How much time does your planet take to complete a revolution around your star or blackhole?
Days  : 365
Hours : 6
How many hours do you folks have in a day?
24
Your planet will have 365 days in a year and a leap year every 4 years.
```
Note: The values in the above example may be innacurate.
