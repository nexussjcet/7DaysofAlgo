## Code Explanation
* The function `spell_it()` is declared and input from the user(any number between 0 and 999) is passed to the function
* A dictionary `dict_ref` is used to store some selected numbers and its corresponding word representation as key-value pairs that is inevitable for spelling the numbers between 0 and 999
* If the input number is 0, then "zero" is displayed 
* The input number is split as digits and length of the input number is found using `len()`
  * Depending on the length of the input number and index position of the digits, mathematical operations are performed and
    accordingly the function `spell_it()` is recursively called , and the numbers are mapped to the word representation of the numbers in `dict_ref` and word representation of the number is displayed.

 
 ## Output
 number| number in words          |
---    | ---                      |
 | 6   |six                       |
 | 15  |fifteen                   | 
 | 102 |one hundred two           |
 | 123 |one hundred twenty three  |
 | 456 |four hundred fifty six    |
