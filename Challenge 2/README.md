# Challenge 2: Spell it out.
## Problem Statement 

    Implement a pure function that takes a whole number as an argument/input and returns the number in words.      
	eg: 26 would return a string ‘twenty six’.  

    The program should be able to handle input atleast till 999 (in the hundreds range)       
	output: ‘nine hundred ninety nine’

Code that can handle larger inputs are also welcome :smiley:
